## Overview

Active ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) requires intensive immunosuppressive therapy, but continued treatment after remission causes substantial morbidity. Routine biomarkers such as CRP and ANCA have limited sensitivity and specificity for identifying remission.

This repository contains the analysis code, frozen model objects, and validation outputs for a multi-stage machine learning pipeline that identifies and validates a **7-protein plasma biomarker panel**:

AHSG · CLEC3B · COMP · F9 · LRG1 · MCAM · MRC1

The panel was developed using **targeted PRM-MS proteomics** and validated in:

* an independent external cohort
* a pooled 60/40 re-split validation
* multiple internal validation procedures

## Reproducibility

All analysis steps are documented chronologically in:

```
supplementary_tables/extended_methods.pdf
```

Frozen model objects (`.rds`) and prediction outputs are provided so that all reported figures and tables can be reproduced without rerunning the full pipeline.

Random seeds used:

| Step          | Seed |
| ------------- | ---- |
| 80/20 split   | 123  |
| LASSO CV      | 42   |
| Boruta        | 1234 |
| 60/40 split   | 7    |
| AUC bootstrap | 7    |
| DCA bootstrap | 2023 |
